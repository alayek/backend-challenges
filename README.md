# Backend Challenges [WIP]

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/BackendChallanges](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/BackendChallanges)

This contains the sample implementations for various standard problems to test the [REPL API](https://repl.it/api).

The implementations have to be in one of these languages or frameworks
>- Python
- Java
- Go
- PHP
- Ruby
- Elixir
- .NET (C#)

Not all of these are supported on [REPL](https://repl.it/) at the moment; but for now, we are populating with code samples with the hope that it would be available in near future.
